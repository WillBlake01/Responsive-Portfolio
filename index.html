				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<img src="assets/images/profile-pic.png" class="auth-image" alt="William Blake">

				<p>William Blake is a Web Developer with 12 years of experience in Business Administration. He was born and raised in Austin, TX but enjoys traveling and the great diversity in every region of the United States. He received his BBA in Finance from Texas State University in 2006 before ultimately deciding that a career in a creative field would be a better fit. He most enjoyed his time working for an Entrepreneur running two web stores which furthered his passion for technology and design. He was able to marry skills in coding, graphics editing, Management, Finance, and Business Administration. The demand to approach issues from different perspectives and wear many hats at a small business quenched his thirst as an ENTP, which rarely pass up the opportunity to learn something new. It was during his time there he decided to take the steps necessary to switch fields and after some soul searching ended up attending the Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at the University of Texas.</p>
				<br>
				<p>When he isnâ€™t making computers dance, he spends time playing guitar, learning Spanish and French, running marathons, and trying not to fall down on the soccer field. He is currently working on coding a website to showcase his many hobbies. You can reach him at willblakebooking@gmail.com or on Twitter at @trill_will.</p>
